## 2. Getting Started

Before you start with anything, you need to get Codio setup so that you can  run the examples in this repository, and eventually, develop your team project. To do this, follow the instructions on the [Setting Up Codio](./setting-up-codio.md) page.

If you **encounter technical problems or issues**, you'll need to consult the [Technical FAQ](technical-FAQ.md). Importantly, this page tells you what to do if your particular question or issue is not specifically addressed by the FAQ itself.

**TODO - Donghwan to check**
The [Group Project Brief](Spring-Project-Brief.md) will give necessary details about your group project and assessments. If you have any questions regarding that, please consult the [Project FAQ](https://github.com/UoS-COM1001/com1001-2024/blob/main/project-FAQ.md) and use the Discussion Board/Forum.

## 3. Schedule and Resources

Materials for the module can all be found in this repository, which consists of directories corresponding to content for each week. Files will be added as we proceed through the module. You can clone this repository to your machine to get all the materials automatically, rather than having to download them each time &mdash; just ensure that you regularly do a `git pull`.

Lecture and practical content for this module is front-loaded in weeks 1&ndash;5 so that you have all the knowledge and expertise that you need to complete development and testing of the team project in the remainder of the semester.

**TODO - Donghwan to complete details of supervisor meetings if required **

### Lectures

Lectures will be held on **Tuesday 9&ndash;11am and Thursdays 3&ndash;5pm in the [Diamond](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/diamond-engineering/floor-plans), lecture theatre 1** in weeks 1&ndash;5. There will be a break during 2 hour lectures, and also a (non-assessed) team quiz. There will be a prize in week 5 for the team that performs best overall in the quizzes.

### Practical Sessions

Practical sessions will be held on **Thursdays 5&ndash;6pm in the [Diamond](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/diamond-engineering/floor-plans)**. 

#### Weeks 1&ndash;5

In weeks 1&ndash;5, the practical sessions consist of team exercises, coding challenges, and will offer practical technical help regarding the team project. You will need to bring your own laptop to this session, or use the laptop loan facility.

Where you go and where you sit depends on which team you're in:
* **Teams 1&ndash;23** need to go to **Computer Room 3** on the second floor, and follow the [seating plan for CR3](misc/CR3-seating-plan.pdf).
* **Teams 24&ndash;47** need to go to **Computer Room 5** (formerly known as the Mindsphere lounge) on the ground floor, and follow the [seating plan for CR5](misc/CR5-seating-plan.pdf).

#### Weeks 6&ndash;11

In weeks 6&ndash;11, the practical session will take the form of an (optional) drop-in session. Here, you can talk to us about any technical problems you're experiencing with your code, or ask any other question you like (e.g., re-explaining lecture content) and we'll endeavour to help. This will take place in **Computer Room 3**. The whole room will be reserved so you can use the space to work simultaneously in your teams. 

### Supervisor Meetings

**TODO - Donghwan to check**
Each team will be allocated a supervisor (a member of the department's teaching staff). Each team will meet with their supervisor once a week, **starting in week 2 and finishing in week 11**. These meetings will happen on **Tuesday afternoons between 1-3pm in Computer Room 5** (formerly known as the Mindsphere lounge) on the ground floor of the Diamond. You only need to attend a 15-minute meeting in this two-hour block. The exact time of your team meetings and the seating plan is available [here](misc/CR5-seating-plan-supervisor-meeting.pdf).

There are two types of meetings – "Catch-up" and "Demo". During **"Catch-up" meetings**, supervisors will discuss with you how your project is going and check that all your team members are engaged with it. **Demo meetings** are where you will demonstrate your work to your supervisor. These meetings will happen in the week prior to handing in your work for Iterations 1 and 2. For the demo, your team will need its own device to showcase your work – or, you can use the laptop loan facility.

Note: your team supervisor will focus on monitoring your progress and teamwork, *not* providing technical advice on your project. Technical advice will be available (via the demonstrators) in the scheduled practical sessions listed above.
